Note: If you are not a fairly advanced WPF programmer please ignore this.
This project is for WPF developers to look or modify etc - this is not needed for the above and is for advanced developers, it's purely for reference or to action enhancements to UI. The UI components are modified down used as open source in the ATSQuadroStrategyBase strategy code base to avoid the need for compiled side by side etc:https://github.com/MicroTrendsLtd/NinjaTrader8/tree/main/ATSQuadroStrategyBase.GUI
